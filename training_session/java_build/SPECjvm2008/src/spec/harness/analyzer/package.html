An analyzer package, containing a analysis system that can be used by the harness. An analyzed implements TYInfo, preferrably extends TYInfoBase and collects runtime data during the run, which it reports as a time value pair.
An analyzer is invoked at a regular frequency by the AnalyzersRUnner, all run in the same thread.
