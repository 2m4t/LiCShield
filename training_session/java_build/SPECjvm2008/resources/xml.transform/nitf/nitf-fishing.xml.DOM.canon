<p class="nitfp">The weather was great today in Norfolk, Virginia.
Made me want to take out my boat, manufactured by the <b><a class="org" href="http://www.stockpoint.com/get-quote?ticker=acm">Acme Boat Company</a></b>.</p>

<p class="nitfp">Tides in Norfolk are running normal today. This
weeks article highlights many of this week's fishing issues, and
also presents a reference table of tide times.</p>

<h2 class="nitfhl2">The Tides are High</h2>

<p class="nitfp">As can be seen from the table below, the shores of
Oceanview again present the brightest spots for fishermen and
sandcastle-builders alike.</p>

<p class="nitfp">Based on these tide tables, I believe you can see
that this weekend stands to be an excellent one for small- or
large-scale fishing exhibitions.</p>

<p class="nitfp">There are many local nooks that fishing fans may
want to keep a special eye one.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Deer Creek:</b> This area has proven to be a bass-lover's
haven. Wilt Monthaven reports that examples of bass over 30 inches
long have been reeled-in by both the casual and the professional
angler.</li>

<li><b>Fox Run:</b> A bit more difficult, logistically, to
navigate. However, the reports of Sturgeon in this area have put it
on the fishing map for the first time since 1996.</li>

<li><b>Pheasant Hollow:</b> If you don't mind the crowds, this old
favorite has come through this year. More fish than you can shake a
stick at. Or a rod at.</li>
</ul>

<p class="nitfp">Happy fishing everybody!</p>
