		<p>The weather was great today in Norfolk, Virginia. Made me want to take
		out my boat, manufactured by the <org value="acm" idsrc="iptc.org">Acme Boat Company</org>.</p>
		<p>Tides in Norfolk are running normal today. This weeks article highlights many of
		this week's fishing issues, and also presents a reference table of tide times.</p>
		<hl2>The Tides are High</hl2>
		<p>As can be seen from the table below, the shores of Oceanview again present the 
		brightest spots for fishermen and sandcastle-builders alike.</p>

		<p>Based on these tide tables, I believe you can see that this weekend stands to be
		an excellent one for small- or large-scale fishing exhibitions.</p>

		<p>There are many local nooks that fishing fans may want to keep a special eye one.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li><em>Deer Creek:</em> This area has proven to be a bass-lover's haven. Wilt Monthaven reports
		that examples of bass over 30 inches long have been reeled-in by both the casual
		and the professional angler.</li>
		<li><em>Fox Run:</em> A bit more difficult, logistically, to navigate. However, the reports
		of Sturgeon in this area have put it on the fishing map for the first time
		since 1996.</li>
		<li><em>Pheasant Hollow:</em> If you don't mind the crowds, this old favorite has come through
		this year. More fish than you can shake a stick at. Or a rod at.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Happy fishing everybody!</p>
