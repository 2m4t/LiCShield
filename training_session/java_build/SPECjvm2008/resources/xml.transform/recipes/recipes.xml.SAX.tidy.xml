<h1>Beef Parmesan with Garlic Angel Hair Pasta</h1>

<ul>
<li>1.5 pounds of beef cube steak</li>

<li>1 onion, sliced into thin rings</li>

<li>1 green bell pepper, sliced in rings</li>

<li>1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>

<li>0.5 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>

<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>

<li>1 jar of spaghetti sauce</li>

<li>0.5 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

<li>12 ounces of angel hair pasta</li>

<li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>

<li>0.25 cup of butter</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

<li>Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the
bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying
pan, and saute 1 teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry
(brown quickly on both sides) meat. Place meat in a casserole
baking dish, slightly overlapping edges. Place onion rings and
peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce over all.</li>

<li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes,
depending on the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over
meat and leave in the oven till bubbly.</li>

<li>Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon
garlic. For a stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top
with grated parmesan and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce
atop a mound of pasta!</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li type="square">Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over
night, the acid in the tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even
more. If you do this, save the mozzarella till the last
minute.</li>

<h1>Ricotta Pie</h1>

<ul>
<li>filling</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>3 pounds of ricotta cheese</li>

<li>12 eggs</li>

<li>2 cups of white sugar</li>

<li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>

<li>0.25 cup of semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Beat the 12 eggs, 2 cups sugar and vanilla extract together.
Stir in the ricotta cheese and the chocolate chips. Set aside.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>dough</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>4 cups of flour</li>

<li>5 teaspoons of baking powder</li>

<li>1 cup of white sugar</li>

<li>0.5 cup of shortening</li>

<li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>

<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and 1 cup of the sugar
together. Cut in the shortening and mix until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Mix in 4 of the eggs and 1 teaspoon of the vanilla.
Divide dough into 4 balls and chill (if needed).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>milk</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two deep
dish pie plates.</li>

<li>Roll out 2 of the balls to fit into the pie pans. Do not make
the crust too thick as it will expand during cooking and get too
thick. Do not flute the edges of the dough. Roll out the other 2
balls of dough and cut each into 8 narow strips for the top of the
crust. Alternately you can use cookie cutters and place the cutouts
on the top of the pies.</li>

<li>Pour the filling evenly into the pie crusts. Top each pie with
8 narow strips of dough or cookie cut-outs. Brush top of pie with
milk for shine. Place foil on the edge of crust.</li>

<li>Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes then
remove foil. Continue to bake for another 25 or 30 minutes or until
a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>

<h1>Cailles en Sarcophages</h1>

<ul>
<li>pastry</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>15 ounces of chilled unsalted butter</li>

<li>3 cups of flour</li>

<li>1.5 teaspoons of salt</li>

<li>0.75 cup of ice water</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, cut 6 tablespoons of the butter into the flour
with a pastry blender until the butter is more or less
incorporated. Now coarsely cut the remaining butter into the flour
mixture, leaving many visible pieces of butter (about 1/4 inch in
diameter should be fine).</li>

<li>Dissolve the salt into the ice water. Slowly drizzle the salted
water into the flour mixture while tossing gently with a fork. When
all the water has been evenly distributed, there will remain many
dry crumbs. Don't wory.</li>

<li>Empty the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. By
folding up the four sides of the wrap and pressing, form a
rectangle of dough. Roll the dough out just a bit and fold the
sides over the middle, forming a piece one third the former size.
Repeat, this time folding the top and bottom to the middle. The
butter and flour will not yet be working in harmony, so you will
probably have to use the plastic wrap to aid you in the first few
folds.</li>

<li>Puff pastry requires a somewhat Calvinist submission of the
will and a confidence that layers will appear. Roll the dough out
again and repeat the folding, lightly dusting with flour between
every layer. Discard the plastic wrap as soon as the dough holds
together on its own.</li>

<li>The dough will become progressively softer as you work on it,
with an almost springy texture. After 6 or 10 repetitions of the
folding and rolling, cut the dough into 18 equal pieces. Wrap each
well in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least
2 hours.</li>

</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Skim any fat off the stock and

until it's tender and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes for
the breasts, a little longer for the legs and thighs.</li>

<li>Reserve the juices from one of the baking dishes, skimming the
fat off the top. Skin, bone and chill the chicken.</li>

shery. Cook until reduced by half.</li>

<li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat and

damp, clean towels. Lightly dust with flour and roll each of the 18
pieces of dough to a diameter of 6 to 8 inches. Set aside.Place
about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture into a half sheet of phyllo
and wrap like an egg roll into a neat, tight package. Place the
phyllo-wrapped chicken on the rolled dough, and brush the egg white
around it.</li>

<li>Fold the bottom of the dough up onto the phyllo to form the
foot of the coffin. Then fold up the sides and top of the dough,
pinching it together to make a cross shape on the top. Repeat for
each sarcophage. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1
hour.</li>
