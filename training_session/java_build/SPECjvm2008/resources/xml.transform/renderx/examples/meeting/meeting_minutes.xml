                    Alex reports that Martin Duke has sent his resignation to the board of directors and notes we will need another
                    board member at some point to get back to 5 people on the board. He suggests people come up with names so they
                    can be discussed on the board list and the people we like can be added to the board at the next meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three people are mentioned:
                </p>
              <p indent="10">
                  * Michael Bull suggests Drew Streib. Drew was one of the early "Castle Commerce" people, and is also active in
                    projects such as the Unic Standards Group's key analysis and others.
              </p>
                <p indent="10">
                  * Alex asks Martin if he would be interesting in becoming a board member. Martin is interested but would like more
                    time to consider it.
                </p>
                <p indent="10">
                  * Alex also proposes Thomas Bushnell, one of the Hurd developers.

                    Alex asks Michael if he has incorporated the changes he suggested
                    for the July 17 minutes. Michael replies that he has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Jonathan lost his changes for the August 7 minutes, and the September 17 minutes
                    are not in order yet, voting for them is postponed until the next board meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michael asks everyone to use ISO 8601 notation for dates in order to prevent confusion. Nobody objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the minutes for August 7 and September 17 are not ready
                    voting on them is postponed until the next board meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vote to approve the minutes of the October 22 meeting minutes was anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vote to approve the minutes of the November 13 meeting minutes was anonymous.

                    Alex asked everyone if they have read Ian's email. Not everyone has. Ian offers to
                    rewrite his proposal as a resolution which will be resolution N-2001-11-26.1. Michael
                    remarks he has no strong feelings on this topic and will vote with the majority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ian asks over how long a period votes should be counted. Alex proposes a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resolution is passed with 4votes in favour and none against.

                    Michael asks for permission to ask Chris to go ahead and mail a letter to
                    Darren Benham pressuring him to surrender all "Castle Commerce" materials
                    he still holds. Alex asks Sean Perry for a last check to see if he has made
                    any progressing in obtaining them. Michael proposes to try and contact Sean
                    and Darren today for a last time, and if no progress has been made yet to
                    proceed with the letter. Nobody objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jonathan mentions we also need to take care of the P.O.Box and ask if he can
                    spend the 19 US dollar needed to open a P.O.Box in Indianapolis. Alex says he
                    would rather have a forwarding service that we can continue to use when the
                    board changes. Jonathan agrees but explains that we need a registered agent
                    to do that so can not be done until he has the "Castle Commerce" materials
                    that Darren currently holds.
