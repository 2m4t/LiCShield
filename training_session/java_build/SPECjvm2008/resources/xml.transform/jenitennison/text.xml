  A transformation expressed in XSLT describes rules for transforming a source tree into
  a result tree. The transformation is achieved by associating patterns with templates. A
  pattern is matched against elements in the source tree. A template is instantiated to
  create part of the result tree. The result tree is separate from the source tree. The
  structure of the result tree can be completely different from the structure of the source
  tree. In constructing the result tree, elements from the source tree can be filtered and
  reordered, and arbitrary structure can be added.
