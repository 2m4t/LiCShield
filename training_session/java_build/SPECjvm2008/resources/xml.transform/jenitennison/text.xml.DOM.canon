transformation XSLT source tree result tree template A
transformation expressed in XSLT describes rules for transforming a
source tree into a result tree. The transformation is achieved by
associating patterns with templates. A pattern is matched against
elements in the source tree. A template is instantiated to create
part of the result tree. The result tree is separate from the
source tree. The structure of the result tree can be completely
different from the structure of the source tree. In constructing
the result tree, elements from the source tree can be filtered and
reordered, and arbitrary structure can be added. A transformation
expressed in XSLT describes rules for transforming a source tree
into a result tree. The transformation is achieved by associating
patterns with templates. A pattern is matched against elements in
the source tree. A template is instantiated to create part of the
result tree. The result tree is separate from the source tree. The
structure of the result tree can be completely different from the
