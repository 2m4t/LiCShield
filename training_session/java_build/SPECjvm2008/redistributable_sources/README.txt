-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The redistributable_sources/licenses subdirectory on the SPECjvm2008
CD-ROM contains copies of the licenses that cover the freely-available 
and redistributable archives used for the SPECjvm2008 suite.

The redistributable_sources/packages subdirectory on the SPECjvm2008
DVD-ROM contains archives of the sources that were used 
for various SPECjvm2008 tools and benchmarks.

These archives are provided primarily for reference purposes, so that
interested parties can investigate the changes required to turn an
application into a benchmark.  Some of the archives must also be here
to satisfy requirements of their licenses.
