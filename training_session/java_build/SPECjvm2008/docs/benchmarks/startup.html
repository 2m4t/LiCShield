        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This benchmark starts each benchmark for one operation.  A new
            JVM is launched and time is measured from start to end. Start up
            benchmark is single-threaded. This allows multi-threaded JVM 
            optimizations at startup time. Startup launcher 
            is required to be the same as a 'main' JVM for submissions. 
            Both startup launcher and arguments for startup launcher can be
            modified. Each startup benchmark runs the suite with the single 
            benchmark. Each non-startup benchmark is used as startup benchmark
            argument, except derby. Startup.scimark benchmarks use 512Kbytes datasets.
